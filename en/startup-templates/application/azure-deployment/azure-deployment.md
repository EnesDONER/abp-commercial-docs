> This document assumes that you prefer to use **{{ UI_Value }}** as the UI framework and **{{ DB_Value }}** as the database provider. For other options, please change the preference on top of this document.

## Prerequisites

- An active Azure account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)

- Your ABP **{{ UI_Value }}** project should be ready at GitHub repository, because we will use GitHub Actions to deploy your application to Azure Web App Service.

- **{{ DB_Value }}** database should be ready to use with your project. If you don't have a database, you can create a new azure sql database or cosmos db by following the instructions below:

    - [Create a new Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/single-database-create-quickstart?tabs=azure-portal)

    - [Create a new Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/create-cosmosdb-resources-portal)


## Description of the process in three steps:

### Step 1: [Creating an Azure Web App Service Environment ](step1-create-azure-resources)

### Step 2: [Customizing the Configuration of Your ABP Application](step2-configuration-application)

### Step 3: [Deploying Your Application to Azure Web App Service](step3-deployment-github-action)
