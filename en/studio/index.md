# ABP Studio

ABP Studio is a **cross-platform** desktop application for ABP and .NET developers. It is well integrated to [ABP Framework](https://abp.io/) and [ABP Commercial](https://commercial.abp.io/). It aims to provide a comfortable development environment for you by automating things, providing insights about your solution, making develop, run, browse, monitor, trace and deploy your solutions much easier.

> ABP Studio is currently in early preview. Documentation work is still ongoing.
