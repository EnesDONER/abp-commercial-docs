* Document Notes
  * Quick Start: Creating a Layered Web Application
    * Make that tutorial with options (UI and Database), like our getting started / web app dev tutorial
    * Re-take welcome page screenshot when the large logo is removed
    * Re-take *Create new solution* wizard screenshot when we change it to Application (Layered)
    * Re-take *Solution Properties* wizard page screenshot to hide *Use local ABP Framework* option
    * Re-take *UI Theme* wizard page screenshot to remove the old *Lepton theme* selection
    * Re-take *Database Configurations* wizard page screenshot to change connection string to LocalDb.
    * Re-take the abp-studio-created-new-solution.png (after ABP Studio logo is removed from the welcome page).
* Other Notes
  * We should support MAUI Blazor Hybrid UI option as well.
  * App-pro template: Root `aspnet-core` folder should not be exists. Event if the Angular UI is selected, we can create `angular` folder inside the root folder of the .NET solution.
